# Configuration

[<- Back to Index](../index.md)

This section describes how you can configure your dapr-openfeign-spring-boot-starter application.

This artifact relies on dapr-client-spring-boot-starter, please refer to [Dapr Client Spring Boot Starter Configuration](../client/configuration.md) for its configuration.

In the current version, we do not provide separate settings for the openfeign client; all parameters use the openfeign settings. You can refer to the openfeign documentation to configure the client.
